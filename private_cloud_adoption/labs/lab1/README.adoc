= Private Cloud Adoption - Lab 1

:numbered:

== Lab 1 Overivew

In this lab, students will play a role of the cloud operator working with a pre-configured OpenStack environment. They will add a new environment for a developer. This first tenant will be configured via the Horizon UI and steps will be provided so that any students that do not have any OpenStack experience will be introduced to this workflow in a gentle manner.

=== References
The following resources will be helpful in the labs that follow:

* https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/pike/user/

=== Access Controller

* http://ctrl01-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
* username: admin
* password: <instructor will provide>

== Lab Goals

. Configure tenant 1 via Horizon UI called "TATE_UI"
. Add custom security group called “TATE_UI”
. Enable Ingress ports for icmp and SSH
. Create a network called “TATE_UI”
. Create a subnet called “TATE_UI”
. Create a router called “TATE_UI” that connects your network to the public network
. Boot a test server
. Assign a Floating IP to this server
. Verify you can ping and SSH to this server from outside the OpenStack environment (from `workstation`)
. Create a volume and attach it to this server
. Ensure this volume is visible in the server

== Detailed Steps
TIP: If you are already familiar with this process you are highly encouraged to skip the instructions and do this on your own. 

=== User and Project Creation

. Login to the Horizon UI as *admin* 
+
. Create a new project
.. Choose +Identity+ in the primary menu bar at the top
.. Select +Projects+ in the tertiary menu bar
.. Choose +Create Project+ in the upper right named something like +TATE_UI+
.. Provide a name for a project
. Create a new user
.. Select +Users+ in the tertiary bar
.. Select +Create User+ in the upper right named something like +TATE_UI+
.. Create a new user and add it to the newly created project with the default role `_member_`


[[Project_User_Operations]]
== Project/Tenant User Operations

. Logout as admin in the top right
. Login as the new user

NOTE: *The remainder of these steps will be done as this user*

=== Create SSH KeyPair

A public/private keypair will be used to allow SSH access to instances. The public key is injected to the instances.

. Select +Project+ in the primary menu bar
. Select +Compute+ in the secondary menu bar
. Choose +Access & Security+ in the tertiary menu bar
. Choose +Keypairs+ in the main panel (second tab over)
. Select +Create Key Pair+ in the upper right
+
NOTE: An existing public SSH key can be imported instead of creating a new one
+
. The new keypair will attempt to download automatically. If needed, use the link to download the private key. This is the private key that will be used to access instances. The public key will be injected into each instance.
. Set the proper permissions on the private key
+
----
chmod 600 <downloaded_user_key>.pem
----


=== Network Management

NOTE: Perform these steps as the project/tenant user for a Neutron deployment

. Create a network
.. At the top select +Project+
.. In the secondary bar select +Network+ then +Networks+
.. Select +Create Network+ button in the top right in the main panel
.. Provide a name such as _private_ or similar
.. Under Subnet tab provide a name such as _private_ and choose +Next+
.. For +Network Address+ specify CIDR like 10.10.10.0/24
.. Leave the rest of the values as default
.. Select +Next+ to provide +Subnet Details+
.. Leave +Enable DHCP+ checked as it will provide IPs for the instances on this private network
.. Leave Allocation Pools blank as the private subnet will not provide any floating IPs
.. For +DNS Name Servers+ use 8.8.8.8
.. Select +Create+ to complete the network and subnet creation

. Create a router
.. In the tertiary menu bar select +Routers+
.. Select +Create Router+ in the upper right and provide a name
.. For _external_network_ choose the *public* network created by Admin 
.. Click on the router name that was just created to reveal details about the router
.. Click +Interfaces+
.. Select +Add Interface+ 
.. Select the *private* subnet created and click +Add interface+
. View the new network topology
.. In the tertiary bar choose +Network Topology+
.. Your topology should look similar to the following:

[[Launch_An_Instance_GUI]]
=== Launch An Instance

. Select +Project+ in the primary menu bar
. Select +Compute+ in the secondary menu bar
. Select +Instances+ in the tertiary menu bar
. Choose +Launch Instance+ in the top right of the main panel
. Choose a name for the new instance
. For flavor use *m1.small* for the *rhel7* or *m1.tiny* for *cirros*
. For +Instance Boot Source+ select +Boot from Image+
. Under +Image Name+ select the desired image
. For +Access & Security+ the key you created earlier should be selected
. For +Networking+ the private network should be selected

.. The +Pool+ should be set to the +public+ network
.. Select +Allocate IP+ to create the floating IP and reserve it for use by this project
+
NOTE: Now that you know the long way, you can also do it directly from the +Associate+ menu below by clicking the +
+
. Associate floating IP instance
.. Select +Instances+ in the tertiary menu bar (or go to +Project+ -> +Compute+ -> +Instances+)
.. For an instance select +More+ under +Actions+ to the right (you can also allocate an IP from this menu) 
.. Choose +Associate Floating IP+
.. Select an available floating IP address from the list
.. The instance and private IP should be selected for +Port to be associated+ 
.. Click +Associate+
